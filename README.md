# Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Dataset
## Overview
This project is part of the dibimbing.id Bootcamp aimed at learning and applying the basic steps of data analysis using the Titanic dataset. The main focus of this project is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization to understand the factors that influenced the survival of Titanic passengers.

## Project Description
This project uses the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers who survived and those who did not in the Titanic disaster. Using Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project will identify significant patterns in the data, such as the impact of age, gender, and other factors on passenger survival. The dataset contains the following columns:
1. name: The name of the passenger.
2. survived: Whether the passenger survived or not.
3. sex: The gender of the passenger.
4. age: The age of the passenger.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values by using mode for categorical columns and median for numerical columns. Remove duplicate records to maintain data quality.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distributions of key variables and explore relationships between different factors influencing survival, such as age and gender.
3. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to support findings and make it easier to interpret the data (e.g., pie charts, bar plots, heatmaps).

## Objectives
1. Understanding the structure of the dataset by looking at data samples and other information.
2. Summarizing basic statistics to understand the data distribution and its characteristics.
3. Identifying and handling duplicate data to maintain quality.
4. Identifying and selecting the best approach to handle missing values.
5. Creating simple visualizations to make data easier to understand.
